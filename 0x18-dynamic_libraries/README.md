 by Julien Barbier, co-founder at Holberton School

 Ongoing project - started 12-16-2019, must end by 12-17-2019
 (in about 15 hours) - you're done withn100% of tasks.

 Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)

 QA review fully automated.

 Learning Objectives
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone,
without the help of Google:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
General
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one,
and how to use it
What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
What are the differences between static and shared libraries

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------
C
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4
using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style.
It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library.
Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file.
If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.
You can use them to test your functions,
but you don’t have to push them to your repo
(if you do we won’t take them into account).
We will use our own main.c files at compilation.
Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype
of the function _putchar should be included in your header file
called holberton.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
-----------------------------------------------------------
bash
---------------------------------------------------------------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line (why?)
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project,
describing what each script is doing
All your files must be executable
